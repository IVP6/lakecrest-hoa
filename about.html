                        <p>Jessi Orsini is a dynamic force of resilience and creativity. Originally from outside

                            joined the U.S. Army at eighteen, serving as a medic in the reserves for eight years—a role
                            that honed her discipline,
                            compassion, and leadership. While pursuing Marine Biology at Clearwater Christian College,
                            she met her husband in St.

                            Jessi’s professional path
                            spans hospitality, healthcare, and entrepreneurship. She owns a thriving soap-making
                            business and is a published author,
                            blending scientific curiosity with artistic flair. Whether mentoring others, building
                            community, or exploring the
